# Slide Simplification Guidelines

## Core Principles

### 1. One Slide, One Message
- Each slide should convey a single, clear message
- Avoid information overload
- Supplement details verbally or in separate materials

### 2. Title Rules (`##`)
- **Maximum 30 full-width characters** (or ~60 half-width characters)
- **Must fit on one line** - wrapping breaks the layout
- Keep titles concise and clear

### 3. Content Guidelines

#### Text and Bullet Points
- **Characters per line:** 35-45 full-width characters
- **Bullet points per slide:** 5-7 items maximum
- **Lines per bullet point:** 1-2 lines ideally
- **Paragraph lines:** 5-7 lines maximum

#### Subtitle Rules (`###`)
- Maximum 15 full-width characters
- Use for section breaks or sub-headings only

#### Tables
- **Columns:** 3-4 maximum
- Keep cell content concise
- Consider bullet points for complex data

## Simplification Strategies

- Break long paragraphs into bullet points
- Add whitespace for readability
